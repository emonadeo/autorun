Hands-free walking and sprinting in Minecraft

## Installation

You can download the Auto-Run mod on [GitHub](https://github.com/Emonadeo/autorun/releases), [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/autorun-fabric) or [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/autorun).

Please let me know if you find any other website distributing this mod.

See https://docs.fabricmc.net/players/installing-mods on how to install mods.

### Dependencies

Install these mods alongside Auto-Run.

-   [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api) is **required**
-   [Mod Menu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu) and [Cloth Config API](https://modrinth.com/mod/cloth-config) are **optional**

### Cross-version support

When a new Minecraft update drops, most of the times this mod “just works”.
For example `autorun-mc1.21.2-v1.1.0.jar` also works in 1.21.3 and 1.21.4.

Consider the `mc1.21.2` in the tag as the minimum Minecraft version this mod runs on. Check the [Compatiblity on Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/autorun/versions) or [Game Versions on CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/autorun-fabric/files) to see which Auto-Run version is compatible with what Minecraft versions.

If you cannot find a compatible version it's worth trying out the latest version of Auto-Run. In the best case it just works. In the worst case Minecraft crashes when you try to launch it.

In that case please create a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/emonadeo/autorun/issues/new) and I will either update the version compatibility chart or release a new version if needed.

## Usage

Press <kbd>O</kbd> to toggle Auto-Run.
If you hold a specific direction during activation, it will in that direction.
You can also hit the sprint key to sprint while auto-walking.

This keybind can be customized in the controls options.

## FAQ

### Can I use it in my modpack?

**Yes.**

### Do I need to install Auto-Run on the server?

**No.** In fact you should **not** install it on the server.
This is a **client-side only** mod and should only be installed on the client.
